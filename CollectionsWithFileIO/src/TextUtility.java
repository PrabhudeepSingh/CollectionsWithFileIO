				"We live in a world that, although it has borders, it is limitless. People can travel anywhere, see anything, experience every feeling that ever existed, but we are not satisfied. We try to impose borders on ourselves, we fight today to be recognized as not belonging to “their community”, to be labeled as part of a smaller group. We fight today to impose limits to a world in which yesterday people have fought so that it didn`t have any. And we applauded them.\r\n" +

				"Yeah today I will tell stories of three people who are the biggest example of humanity and they are human lover.\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"Firstly just imagine yourself I fill this class with garbage how will you feel like you will not stay in this but there is one who go in that garbage search there and you what he found. He found a dead body of child he took that body washed it and buried that body and from that day he used to search in garbage with his wife this man is no other than Mr. Abdul Sattar Edhi the lover of humanity . He is the founder and head of the Edhi Foundation, a non-profit social welfare organization in Pakistan. He is the man who serve is whole life serving for humanity without any selfishness. He has bathed and buried over a thousand unclaimed bodies in a time when selfishness and greed are at their peak and nobody seems to know the meaning of words like altruism and selflessness. His achievements in the field of charity are bound to make one think that his name is synonymous to nobility and humanity. And today he is running Pakistan biggest network of ambulances and shelter.\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"Moreover his charity does not discriminate based on religion, race or gender. For him, religion is human rights. Edhi has spent many sleepless nights working and serving for humanity whether it is to bury unclaimed bodies or feeding any poor. Besides it he lives a simple life living in small house many of times he used to sleep on the concrete or on the small batch outside his shop his qualities makes him the man of simplicity and human being lover.\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"As Edhi Said: \"No religion is higher than Humanity\"\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"Secondly I will talk tell you about a person who is basically a Pakistani but he is living in Canada he had son named as Ali and his son was 18 years old this man lost his son in accident. The accident was like that his son was working part time as pizza delivery boy when he was on the way for the delivery one black guy who was also of his age come before him and said him money but Ali was honest with his job he refuse that and that guy shoot him that time. When Ali's father came to know about his son's death he was in shock and after few days police caught the person who killed his son and called Ali's father to come when he reach there he came to know that boy who killed his son is 18 years old he is orphan u people know at that time what he said u guys can't believe it Ali's father said \"I don't want to do any case on this boy I want to adopt this boy and want to take all responsibilities of this boy because today I lost my son I don't want tomorrow somebody else lose his 18 years old son\". Just for a minute place yourself on the place of Ali's father what will be you feeling your 18 years old son shoot dead. Ali's father this act of humanity raise whole mankind and today he has 4 orphanages in Canada where he take responsibility of around 800 children.\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"Thirdly the person I am talking about is the well-known personality the person who give us world cup in 1992 he is great leader and humanity lover he is Imran Khan. Most notable among his humanitarian efforts has been the establishment of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, named after his late mother. It is Pakistan's first and only cancer hospital that provides 75% free health care, and was built on public donations. Imran is now building a second hospital in Karachi, based on the successful Lahore model. In 1994, he inaugurated Namal College, a technical college which is now an associated college of University of Bradford.\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"Although these people do things for humanity on larger scale we should come on ourselves what we have do for humanity every day we spend our time hanging around with friends going outside for parties have we ever feed a poor person on the road have we ever realize how poor people live their lives no we haven't because we never realize that for what we are in this world we never realize our duties towards humanity.\r\n" + 
				"\r\n" + 
				"We should must realize for what we are in this world because every religion teach us humanity and one who serve humanity is the happiest man on the globe real happiness is your inner satisfaction which you can get by serving humanity what so ever how much you are rich you can't buy inner happiness.";
